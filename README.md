# SBSC
This repository provides the implementation of our clustering algorithm, named SBSC.

A python notebook file is provided along with neccessary files, such as two synthetic datasets to test the algorithm and "k_mst2.pyx" file to perform 2-rounds of MST faster.

The code needs cython to use the "k_mst2" library.
